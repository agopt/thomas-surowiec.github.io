The school will take place on **September 8-10, 2021** and will be a purely virtual event hosted by [Thomas M. Surowiec](https://www.mathematik.uni-marburg.de/~surowiec/) at [Philipps-Universit√§t Marburg](https://www.uni-marburg.de/de).  Please use [this form](https://forms.gle/kQrbpkTYHJwCYxDr7) to register so that we can judge how many people will be attending this (purely virtual) event.
