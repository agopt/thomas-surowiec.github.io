The school will take place on **September 8-10, 2021** and will be a purely virtual event hosted by [Thomas M. Surowiec](https://www.mathematik.uni-marburg.de/~surowiec/) at [Philipps-Universität Marburg](https://www.uni-marburg.de/de).  Please use [this form](https://forms.gle/kQrbpkTYHJwCYxDr7) to register as soon as possible. Depending on the number of responses, there will be a chance for short presentations by young researchers on at least one of the three days. There are **no fees** for this event. A zoom link will be sent via email to all registered individuals once the schedule is finalized. 


The school intends to introduce key components of **uncertainty quantification** and **stochastic optimization of complex systems**. The tandem courses **_PDE-Constrained Optimization under Uncertainty_** and **_Bayesian Inverse Problems_** provide two complementary topics for treating complex systems subject to uncertainty. Some of the ideas of from these two courses are extended to a dynamic setting in **_Dynamic and Multistage Stochastic Optimization_**. Efficient numerical methods for treating random PDEs are presented in **_Multilevel Methods for Random PDEs_**. Finally, the attendees will be given some firsthand experience on the application of stochastic optimization in industy via **_Optimization under Uncertainty in Industrial Applications_**.

# Course Descriptions

## PDE-Constrained Optimization under Uncertainty
## Optimization und Uncertainty in Industrial Applications

Course Part I:
 
Title: “Energy Problems and Uncertainty”
 
In this talk we will sketch the various layers of energy management problems and provide details about the various elements. We will provide a description of some of the available assets and provide insights on some of the key technical features to be accounted for. From a decision making perspective we will discuss the various layers of problems: strategic planning, seasonal storage valuation and short-term operations. At each of these layers there is a need to account for uncertainty and a specific impact of their internal dynamics. We will also discuss how some of the vital uncertainty factors are linked with nature.
 
Course Part II:
 
Title: “Exploiting Structure in stochastic programming for Energy management”
 
In this talk we will discuss how one can draw benefits from having identified specific structure within energy management problems. We will also discuss how lack of convexity can be reasonably palliated by exploiting advantageous decomposition strategies. In particular we will showcase some interesting results obtained when moreover these ideas are combined with classic ideas of Bender’s type decomposition. Beyond the scope of handling uncertainty with recourse, we will also present several recent insights in handling uncertainty through the use of probability constraints. More specifically we will mention recent insights w.r.t. the understanding of “convexity” and differentiability of probability functions.

## Dynamic/Multistage Stochastic Optimization
## Multilevel methods for random partial differential equations

Multilevel Monte Carlo methods have become increasingly popular over the last decade, due to their simplicity and their ability to significantly outperform standard Monte Carlo approaches in complex simulation tasks. In this course, we will show how the multilevel methodology can be applied to modelling and simulation using partial differential equations.

The parameters in mathematical models for many physical processes are often impossible to determine fully or accurately, and are hence subject to uncertainty. A particular example is given by the modelling of subsurface flow, where the governing equations are given by Darcy’s law and there is uncertainty in the permeability of the subsurface. By modelling the permeability as a stochastic process, it is possible to quantify the uncertainty also in the model outputs by propagating the uncertainty through the model.

The first part of the course will be introductory, and we will discuss Monte Carlo and multilevel Monte Carlo methods to compute expected values of the model outputs, highlighting the benefits of the multilevel methodology. 

In the second part of the course, we will cover more advanced topics including:
- multilevel methods based on Quasi-Monte Carlo sampling,
- multilevel methods for computing higher order moments and probabilities.

## Bayesian Inverse Problems

# Speaker Biographies

## Drew P. Kouri
## Wim van Ackooij

HdR. Dr. Ir. Wim van Ackooij has worked on energy related optimization problems for nearly 20 years. His interests are in stochastic optimization and probability constraints. While working for EdF, he obtained his PhD from Ecole Centrale Paris and his Habilitation (à Diriger les Recherches) from Paris Panthéon Sorbonne in 2017. He is currently Expert researcher in Stochastic Optimization for EdF Lab. He has developed and participated in the development, through various collaborations, of new insights in the structural properties of probability functions. Some of the new insights involve convexity of feasible sets to probability constraints, but also new insights in (generalized) differentiability. Further work involves decomposition approaches for large scale stochastic optimization problems. More recently, works involve the trade-off between bilevel programming, nonsmooth and variational analysis and stochastic optimization. He is a member of COSP,  the governing board of the Stochastic Programming Society since 2019.  

## Alois Pichler
## Aretha Teckentrup

Aretha Teckentrup is currently a Lecturer in the Mathematics of Data Science at the University of Edinburgh. Before moving to Edinburgh in 2016, she held postdoctoral positions at the University of Warwick and Florida State University. She obtained her PhD from the University of Bath in 2013. Aretha's research interests are  at  the  interface  of  numerical  analysis,  statistics  and  data  science, with a focus on developing, analysing and implementing methods for efficient uncertainty quantification in complex systems. She has experience in multilevel  sampling  methods, Bayesian inverse problems and Gaussian process regression, among other topics, with applications in geophysics.
